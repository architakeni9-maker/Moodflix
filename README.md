# Moodflix
I've created MoodFlix - an interactive mood-based recommendation engine! Here's what makes it special:
🎨 Creative Features:

> Mood Categories - From "Happy & Energetic" to "Anxious & Stressed", each with unique colors and icons
> Duration Options - Quick Break (20-40 min), Evening Watch (1-2 hours), or Binge Session (3+ hours)
> Curated Recommendations - Each mood + duration combo gives you 3 personalized picks with vibes explained
> Netflix-Inspired Design - Dark theme with red accents and smooth animations
